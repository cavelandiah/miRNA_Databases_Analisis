Analize data from current databases of miRNAs: miRBase, RFAM and mirGeneDB:Mon Aug 26 13:23:46 CEST 2019

Current annotation of miRNAs could be obtained from different sources, from genome annotation databases
as _Ensembl_ or more dedicated ones as _miRBase_. Herein, I would like to point the attention out the 
current annotated families and _loci_ numbers for a set of 24 chordata species. Those species were selected
based on their phylogenetic relation respect to the Chordata group and more specifically, to complement
the evolutionary road of the Tunicata clade.
