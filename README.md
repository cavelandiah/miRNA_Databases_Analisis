Current annotation of miRNAs could be obtained from different sources, from genome annotation databases
as _Ensembl_ or more dedicated ones as _miRBase_. Herein, I would like to point the attention out the 
current annotated families and _loci_ numbers for a set of 24 chordata species. Those species were selected
based on their phylogenetic relation respect to the Chordata group and more specifically, to complement
the evolutionary road of the Tunicata clade.  

## Strategy

The selected species group is composed by a set of 24 chordata genomes. The main group are classified as
tunicates (15 species), vertebrates (3) and cephalochordates (2). As an outgroup, hemichordata (1) and 
echinodermata (2) genomes were considered. The complete list names, with the assigned unique species tag,
are described later.

In this approach, target databases are: [miRBase](http://www.mirbase.org/)v. 22, [RFAM](https://rfam.xfam.org/)
v. 14.1 and [MirGeneDB](http://mirgenedb.org/) v.2.0. For details about retrieving the bulk data, 
please refer to Code/README.md file.
